🚀 Overview

This project combines React, Fabric.js, and LangChain (Google Gemini LLM) to generate AI-powered visual mind maps.

You simply provide a topic or text input, and the system:

Uses LangChain + Gemini LLM to process your idea.

Generates a structured JSON of nodes and relationships (not plain text!).

Renders that JSON dynamically into an interactive canvas-based mind map using Fabric.js.

✨ Key Highlights

⚛️ React + Fabric.js for dynamic canvas visualization

🧩 LangChain Output Parsers ensure clean, structured JSON

💡 AI → Structure → Visualization pipeline

🖱️ Built-in drag, zoom, and smooth canvas interactions

🧭 Future upgrades: Auto-layout, color-coded relationships, and export features

🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Fabric.js

AI Integration: LangChain (Google Gemini LLM)

Language: JavaScript (ES6+)

🧠 Why This Project

I built this as part of my journey to explore AI in interactive front-end tools —
where logic, creativity, and code meet.

LLMs shouldn’t just talk — they should build.
